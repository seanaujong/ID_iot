Identifying medical devices from their network traffic.

# Project Dependency

Participation with Dell Medical for access to medical device traffic. The number of network attached medical devices in US healthcare environments is rapidly increasing. Medical devices themselves suffer from software vulnerabilities and due to their slow patch cycles are targets for exploitation. Loss or tampering of a device due to a cyber threat in turn can effect patient safety, take for example the hospitals that were shut down due to Wannacry. Medical devices are heterogeneous in terms of their Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). As such, in order to protect them from the vulnerabilities they may exposed, you first need to identify them uniquely.

# Challenge

Create network-based tools that can identify medical devices and possibly their SBOMs from their traffic signatures.

# Operational Constraints

Must be able to identify new devices being added to the network. Must be able to identify different types of medical devices. Must be able to characterize these devices by SBOMs and/or network features.
